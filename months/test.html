        <h3>Warm Up</h3>
        <div class="song">
            What is your name, What is your name? My name is.... My name is.....

        <h3>Lesson</h3>
        <h4>Book Reading</h4>
        <p>Goals: To learn the story and the related key English words and expressions
            Materials: A big book, mp3 file
            Procedures: Lot’s of familiar things in the pictures to talk about. Have fun going through the pages and trying to get the children to speak. Also, as pages come up like “what’s your name?” Don’t be afraid to stop and begin to interact with the children. The goal is not just to read but to engage. Follow this process when reading books.
            1 Introduce the book in an interesting way then take a book walk*.
            2 Play the mp3 book reading file while turning the pages.
            3 Read the story again in your own voice. Change voices for the different characters.
            4 Show the story again, this time ask simple questions about the story and to try to get the
            children to think creatively.
            *Book walk means quietly previewing the book by showing pictures page by page.</p>
        <h3>Closure</h3>
